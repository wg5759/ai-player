The project workflow pins every moving source dependency and builds with `-Dgpl=true` and `-Dffmpeg:gpl=enabled`. Treat this bundled executable as GPL software; do not describe it as an LGPL build.

The local packaging inputs were compared byte-for-byte by SHA-256 against the verified binary archive on 2026-07-19:

| File | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `mpv.exe` | `9ADF2084F8DE4E40C6BC2E6EA099F8F602FCAA478C8CDE5169AED5C7DEA0D02F` |
| `mpv.com` | `B806176C5C1517F4D273C6FA24FDEBF8BCC6FA907288851E450E8318448149A3` |
| `mpv.pdb` | `41368B73560A8EAC2FB97EFFD477BE312581F5C55B0F05F3798F11A3BE5A123D` |
| `vulkan-1.dll` | `9CD597DCA1119ABC535A86BBD42E8BA681D98F00ECB35E616D5691D7AAE23A42` |

Both archives and their binding manifest are publicly hosted in the stable compliance release above. `binary-source-evidence.json` records their fixed URLs, byte sizes and SHA-256 digests; the binary publication gate queries the public GitHub Release API and fails closed if any remote asset changes or disappears.
